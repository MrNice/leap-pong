Hey everyone, you should play some pong!

To Play:

Leap Motion Mode: Hit L on your keyboard, then use one finger to move the blue paddle.

Keyboard Mode: W/S move up/down.

To get started:
Clone the repo and, from the root directory, run:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then point your browser to localhost:8000 in order to play.

I made this @HackReactor's two day hackathon. Because of the way I structured it, I'm having trouble deploying it on Windows Azure (where I have credits).

Level 3 music:
Focus, by Chipzel, from Super Hexagon (which you should buy)
